# R Subsetting Error: Using = Instead of ==

This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming when subsetting data frames. The error arises from incorrectly using the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the comparison operator (`==`) within the subsetting condition.  This leads to unexpected behavior and often difficult-to-debug errors.

The `bug.R` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.R` file shows the corrected code.

This is a crucial issue to understand for anyone working with R and data manipulation.  The incorrect usage can easily lead to subtle and hard-to-find bugs in your code.
